Summary:
-----

The weather on Oahu provides enough warmth for plenty of outside activities, and since hawaii are islands, so the most provided place is the beach. 
June seems to be the best timne for both ice-cream, and surfing.
while Decemeber is the christmas season, but not necessecerily ideal for surfing, not ice-cream, but it will have some working days.
